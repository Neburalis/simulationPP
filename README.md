# simulationPP

this is my implementation of the task from the [lesson](https://zhukovsd.github.io/python-backend-learning-course/Projects/Simulation/)

### Simulation Project

The essence of the project is a step-by-step simulation of a 2D world inhabited by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass), which herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted with - they simply take up space.

The 2D world is an NxM matrix, each creature or object occupies the entire cell, the presence of several objects/creatures in a cell is unacceptable.

The [idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfEZSyvbj2w) is taken from here and simplified.

### Project Motivation

The main goal is to study the principles of application architecture design using OOP.
